# Solana Gauntlet

Install node version with asdf. Which can be done by running this from the base of the chainlink-solana repository:

```bash
make install
```

You can then run yarn to setup yarn from the gauntlet directory

```bash
cd gauntlet
yarn
```

From here you should be setup to run any yarn scripts in the package.json file as needed.
