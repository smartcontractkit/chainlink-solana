# Inspecting Solana Programs

Programs for Solana can be found in the [programs](/contracts/programs/) directory. Here, you can find source code for each of the Chainlink programs deployed on Solana.

- [Access Controller](/contracts/programs/access-controller/)
- [OCR2](/contracts/programs/ocr2/)
- [Store](/contracts/programs/store/)

## Via Gauntlet Inspect

Using Gaunlet, you can inspect the state of Chainlink programs on Solana.

### Inspect Ownership

Gauntlet offers an *inspect_ownership* command for each program. The following is a template for these commands, where PROGRAM_NAME is either ocr2 or access_controller and NETWORK_NAME corresponds to one of the networks defined in the [networks](/gauntlet/packages/gauntlet-solana-contracts/networks/) folder.

```bash
yarn gauntlet [PROGRAM_NAME]:inspect_ownership --network=[NETWORK_NAME] [PROGRAM_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]

e.g.
yarn gauntlet ocr2:inspect_ownership --network=mainnet 2oyA8ZLwuWeAR5ANyDsiEGueUyDC8jFGFLSixSzT9KtV
```

This command logs the owner and proposed owner (if defined) of the program account.

```bash
üß§  gauntlet 0.1.2
‚ÑπÔ∏è   Loading Local wallet
Operator address is H2ScWiFt1ZMRR1beYWB6Yr9cuADJ8sQhkGvYJxjJNAh8

‚ÑπÔ∏è   Proposed Owner: 11111111111111111111111111111111
‚ú®  Done in 12.38s.
```

### OCR2 Inspect

Using Gauntlet, you can query an OCR2 program to obtain information about its oracles and configuration. The following template is used for this command.

```bash
yarn gauntlet ocr2:inspect --network=[NETWORK_NAME] [PROGRAM_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]

e.g.
yarn gauntlet ocr2:inspect --network=devnet 2TQmhSnGK5NwdXBKEmJ8wfwH17rNSQgH11SVdHkYC1ZD
```

You can find an example response below.

```bash
üß§  gauntlet 0.1.2

## Via Solana Explorer

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/) allows users to search for deployed programs and read their state. On the home page, search the address of the program account that you want to inspect. For example, if you want to inspect the OCR2 program for the BTC/USD feed on mainnet, search *2oyA8ZLwuWeAR5ANyDsiEGueUyDC8jFGFLSixSzT9KtV*.

On the program account page, select the *Anchor Account* tab. In this tab, you will be able to inspect all of the data stored on the program in JSON format. In the case of an OCR2 program, this includes on-chain configuration and oracle information.

## Via cURL

You can also interact with deployed programs via cURL. Querying account info using cURL requires the following format.

```bash
curl [RPC_URL] -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getAccountInfo",
    "params": [
      "ACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
      {
        "encoding": "base58"
      }
    ]
  }
'
```

You may need to change the encoding if the data stored by your program is larger than 128 bytes. Here is the result of the above query.

```bash
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "result": {
        "context": {
            "slot":128841900
        },
        "value": {
            "data": ["BASE_58_STRING...","base58"],
            "executable":false,
            "lamports":49054080,
            "owner":"cjg3oHmg9uuPsP8D6g29NWvhySJkdYdAo9D25PRbKXJ",
            "rentEpoch":298
        }
    },
    "id":1
}
```

## Via Solana-CLI

Using [solana-cli](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) produces similar results to cURL. Run the following command to get information about a program account.

```bash
solana account [ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]
```

This command will dump information about the given account.

```bash
Public Key: 2oyA8ZLwuWeAR5ANyDsiEGueUyDC8jFGFLSixSzT9KtV
Balance: 0.04905408 SOL
