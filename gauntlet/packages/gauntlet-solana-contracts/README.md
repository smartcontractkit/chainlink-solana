# solana-gauntlet

### Prepare

```
yarn
```

Create a `.env` on the project root directory, and set your private key as:

```
# .env
PRIVATE_KEY=[38,56,112,28,28,122, ...]
```

Optional: Build binary

```
yarn bundle
```

## Execute commands:

### Contracts available

- Access Controller: `access_controller`
- OCR2: `ocr2`
- Flags: `flags`,
- Deviation flagging store: `store`

### Commands

To execute with binary, change `yarn gauntlet` for `./bin/chainlink-solana-[macos|linux] <command>`

- Deploy

Deployment is available for any of the contracts in the list

```
yarn gauntlet <contract_name>:deploy --network=<testnet|devnet>
```

- Commands available

Contract functions are only available in some contracts. Get the latest supported commands running

```
yarn gauntlet help
```

- Interact with contract

```
yarn gauntlet <contract_name>:<contract_function> --network=<testnet|devnet> --state=<state_account_public_key> [OPTIONAL: --<function_parameter_name=<value>] <contract_address>
```

Command example:

```
yarn gauntlet <contract_name>:<contract_function> --help
```

## Testing Locally

### Preparation

- Include program keypairs under `/packages/gauntlet-solana-contracts/artifacts/programId/*.json`, resulting in:

```
packages/gauntlet-solana-contracts/artifacts/programId
|  access_controller.json
|  store.json
|  ocr2.json
```

- Make sure these accounts public keys correspond to the ones declared on each contract `declare_id`. If they don't, compile the contracts (`anchor build`) with the correct `declare_id` and move the generated binaries from `/target/deploy/*.so` to `/packages/gauntlet-solana-contracts/artifacts/bin/*.so`

- Run a local store node

```
solana config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
solana-test-store -r
```

- Get some SOL on your account. This account needs to be the same specified on gauntlet `.env` `PRIVATE_KEY`

```
solana airdrop 100 9ohrpVDVNKKW1LipksFrmq6wa1oLLYL9QSoYUn4pAQ2v
```

### Running

A flow command can be executed to set up everything needed. Program deployments, initialization, configuration setting and single transmission.

```
SKIP_PROMPTS=true yarn gauntlet ocr2:setup:flow --network=local
```

The result of the command will be stored on `/flow-report.json` file

If any error occurs, the flow can be started from that point, using the previous flow report, as:

```
SKIP_PROMPTS=true yarn gauntlet ocr2:setup:flow --network=local --withReport --start=<step number>
```

After the flow has finished succesfully, more transmissions can be executed, either by:

```
SKIP_PROMPTS=true yarn gauntlet ocr2:setup:flow --network=local --withReport --start=12 --round=2
```

or

```
yarn gauntlet ocr2:transmit --network=local --state=<state_account_public_key> --transmissions=<state_account_public_key> --store=<state_account_public_key> --accessController=<state_account_public_key> --round=<round number>
```

The account public keys can be found inside the `/flow-report.json` file

Make sure to increment the round after every transmission
